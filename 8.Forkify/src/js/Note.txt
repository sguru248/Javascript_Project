////___Event Handlers in MVC :Publisher Subscriber Patter____/////


Publisher-Subscriber Design Pattern:
   Design Pattern in the Programming are basically standard Solution to certain kind of Problems

   We have a 'Publisher' Which is Some code that knows When to react .(In this case addhandlerRender() Method It will contain addEventListener Method from recipeView module)

   other Hand We have 'Subscriber' Which is code that actually want to react.( In this case controlRecipes() function from controller Modules )

   Publisher doesn't know Subscriber really Exist

   It is allow us to keep the Handler in the controller , and to listener in the view

   In summery, the handler subscribes to the publisher(Which is listener in this case ),the Publisher publishes an event , the Subscriber is executed.

////____When we just developing___//////

  1) we use (npm run start)  

  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html --dist-dir ./dist"
  },

  Actually we delet the "main"


  {
  "name": "forkify",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Recipe application",
  "main" : "index.html"                                                       // we delete this file
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html --dist-dir ./dist"                // Here we have specifiy distribution directer and folder name
